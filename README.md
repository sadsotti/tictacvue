## üéØ Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to develop a **single-page application (SPA)** implementing the classic Tic Tac Toe game.

The core development focused on leveraging **Vue** reactive state management, game logic implementation, and dynamic UI updates. Emphasis was placed on creating a **responsive and engaging user interface**, ensuring clear game status feedback (current player, winner/draw), and providing a smooth reset functionality.

Attention was also paid to creating a **responsive layout** and allowing users to toggle between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to clone the repository and run the project:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sadsotti/tictacvue.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd tictacvue
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server (using Vite):**

    This command leverages **Vite** to start a local development server, compile your code instantly, and automatically enable **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** for live updates in the browser.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    You will see the local access URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`) in the console.

5.  **(Optional) Create the production build (using Vite):**

    To generate optimized files for production (bundle, compiled CSS, assets), run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    Compiled files will be saved in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Vite/Vue structure for better maintainability:

* `dist/`: Output folder for the optimized production build.
* `public/`: Static assets (favicon).
* `src/`: Vue source code.
    * `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `Game.vue` for the main game logic/layout).
    * `assets/`: Global CSS (`style.css`), images, and other static assets.
* `index.html`: The entry point for Vite.
* `vite.config.js`: **Vite** configuration file (defines plugins, build options, etc.).
* `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts.
* `README.md`: This project description file.
